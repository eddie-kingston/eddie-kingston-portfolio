A collection of Eddie Kingston's best R scripts.

QI_Bulk_Sends_Rename.R is a script I wrote to automate over half of the process of sending bulk files to partnership managers. These files were used to show value to the partners and get them to sign contracts with Niche.

Creating Backlogs.R is a script I wrote when we were getting a lot of requests from partnership managers whose schools were on the fence about renewing their contract. We had two different kinds of products associated with this and two different methods of pulling those products. This script consolidates those two methods into one.

masters project.Rmd is all the code I wrote to visualize a network of players in an online game of Survivor I helped facilitate in November 2022. I also used three network clustering algorithms to gain insight about who power players were based on their connections to their fellow players.
